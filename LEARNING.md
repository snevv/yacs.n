# Intro 
This file is intended to be a collection of articles and videos that can help new developers get started 
    working on YACS, specifically for webscraping. These are some resources I found useful when I began
    as a developer with no experience in webscraping or any sort of backend development experience. 

As of right now, under each subsection there is not much information regarding each concept/library as 
    there are links in the bibliography that refer to each item with its necessary information. But as the 
    semester progresses, I can add information for each bulletpoint and expand on what to look
    out for specifically when beginning to understand and use each concept/library in YACS 
    development for the purposes of webscraping.
